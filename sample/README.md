There is no sample for [loop](https://github.com/aartikov/Sesame/tree/master/loop). See [LoadingLoop](https://github.com/aartikov/Sesame/blob/master/loading/src/main/kotlin/me/aartikov/sesame/loading/simple/internal/LoadingLoop.kt) and [PagedLoadingLoop](https://github.com/aartikov/Sesame/blob/master/loading/src/main/kotlin/me/aartikov/sesame/loading/paged/internal/PagedLoadingLoop.kt) as good examples how to use it.
