# Compose Sample
[The compose sample](https://github.com/aartikov/Sesame/tree/master/compose-sample) shows how to use Sesame with Jetpack Compose and [Decompose](https://github.com/arkivanov/Decompose). Each screen demonstrates certain Sesame feature.

COUNTER - shows that we don't need [property](https://github.com/aartikov/Sesame/tree/master/sesame-property) to manage Jetpack Compose state. `mutableStateOf` and `derivedStateOf` are used instead.  
PROFILE - loads ordinary data with [loading](https://github.com/aartikov/Sesame/tree/master/sesame-loading).  
DIALOGS - shows how to use [dialog](https://github.com/aartikov/Sesame/tree/master/sesame-dialog) and [localized string](https://github.com/aartikov/Sesame/tree/master/sesame-localized-string).  
MOVIES - loads paged data with [loading](https://github.com/aartikov/Sesame/tree/master/sesame-loading).  
FORM - validates input fields with [compose-form](https://github.com/aartikov/Sesame/tree/master/sesame-compose-form).
